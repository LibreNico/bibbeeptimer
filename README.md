# BibBeep - run race timer by joggans.be

Open source race bib scanning and timing software for run race made by the Joggans club.

It handles all aspects of a run race:
- import runners registration via Excel saved as CSV (template in file tab of https://sourceforge.net/projects/bibbeep/)
- scanning the race bib via barcode scanner or keyboard input
- recording times
- printing results

It is cross-platform, meaning you can use it on Windows, Mac, and Linux and it works offline.
There is by default a backup system and thanks to the backups you  can reload a previous run.

No need for expensive RFID system only one laptop is enough (work even better with code bar scanner).

Notice: you need to first install Java (see https://www.java.com/en/download/) before opening the bibbeep-X.jar application.
